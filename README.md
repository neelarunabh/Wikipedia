# Wikipedia

Since I am currently community-banned on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Neel.arunabh, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=1066833242#Neel.arunabh's_competence_issues), I am posting a message here on Github,  I just want to let everyone know that I will never allow Unicode characters to be deleted. At https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2022_January_18#%E2%8B%BE, a large number of characters were nominated in an RfD two days before I was banned. I mentioned that unicode characters should not be deleted because https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Operators_(Unicode_block) contains aa link to every character. 
Later, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Thryduulf also said that every single unicode character oustide the private use area is a likely search term and should be a blue link. Soft redirects to Wiktionary entries that contain information about the character are fine, redirects to local pages with information about the character (even if it is just a list) are usually better. Now at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2022_March_27#%E2%88%BE, an individual symbol has been renominated and I do not agree with Tavix's rationale to delete this "Inverted Lazy S".  I have to agree with Thryduulf's comment in the previous discussion.
